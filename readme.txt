##My eventual goal is writing a Python 
##program that could do customized searches, tweak the searches 
##easily, and maybe log some statistics.
##Examples of statistics might be how frequently the search 
##results hit a tweet by the same person, or how frequently a person 
##posts a tweet with a keyword in it, and what effectiveness
##rating I'd give to various searches.
